# Rozhin 👋

From mechatronics hardware 🔧 to AI-powered vision 🤖 — I live at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and real-world autonomy.

⚙️ Day job: Data & Applications Analyst — crafting algorithms, shipping robust pipelines, ensuring production-grade reliability.

🛠️ Nights & weekends: Experimenting with computer vision + robotics ideas, learning as I go, and building small tools that solve everyday problems.

🌱 Always down for open-source contribs or cool collaborations.
