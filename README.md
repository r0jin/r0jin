# Rozhin 👋

AI grad with mechatronics roots 🤖  
Now I’m on the software side: turning **computer vision + robotics**  
into things that work in the real world 

Day job: **Data & Applications Analyst** 📊🛠️  
— monitoring + analysing data, building algorithms when needed,  
and shipping end-to-end pipelines: ingest → validate → process → report ⚙️✅  
Also: making messy systems behave 😅

Outside work I build robot behaviors 
perception → decisions → action   
End goal: products that make people’s lives a bit easier ❤️

Right now I’m upgrading my software craft   
(structure, OOP, maintainability)  
— recovering from my old coding philosophy:  
“if it runs, don’t touch it”   
(+ a few sacred print statements)  
New goal: less chaos, more ‘future-me’ friendliness :D
